# Data-Visualization-and-the-Art-of-Storytelling
In 2021, I left behind my 4-year career as an electrical engineer to explore data analytics. While diving into Python, Kaggle competitions, and advanced technologies like AI and ML, I discovered my true passion: Data Visualization. 

I realized many dashboards, including my own, lacked cohesive themes, clear narratives, and the ability to communicate insights independently. This inspired me to combine my technical skills with my lifelong love for art, creating visualizations that tell stories and drive decisions. 

So I made this blog series to share my learnings and experiences on Data Visualization and the Art of Storytelling. In this series, I have shared insights, techniques, and tips for crafting dashboards that are as impactful as they are beautiful. The first article is a glimpse into my journeyâ€”what led me here and why this field means so much to me.
